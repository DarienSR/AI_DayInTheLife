# Determining Agent Behavior with Utility Functions
The point of this project was to understand how Utility AI works. I have placed an Agent (or NPC) in a scene (his apartment) and used Utility AI to model his behavior. 
Performing different actions around his apartment like sleeping, eating, or watching tv. 

# How does Utility AI work?
In it's simplest form numerous actions like "Eating" are defined by it's various considerations (i.e. Am I hungry? Do I have food?, etc). All actions and their considerations are then scored based on the utility (or value) they provided to the agent in that given time (calculations must be done during run-time). The action that provides the most value/utility is then selected.

Scoring can be done through the use of functions/formulas. For simplicity the majority of considerations I defined use Unity's built in AnimationCurve to define a function. To properly compare each consideration, all scores are
normalized between 0 and 1.

###### Why must calculations be done during run-time?

In order for the agents behavior to be accurate and believable, they must take in real-time information in the environment and respond accordingly. For example, if a guard is on his lunch break and the player steps in front of his POV, he needs to response instantly and stop eating to attack the player. 



# Utility AI Breakdown

Here is a generalized breakdown of how the agent / environment stats get converted into considerations / actions:

â€‹				*Note some information is abstracted. This is just a general flow.

An example with numbers thrown in:

In the above case, the action "Read" would be selected because it's overall utility is higher. In my case, Read is an idle action that occurs when no other actions utility is above 0.2.

# Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson I learned throughout this project is the importance of planning and documentation. The theory of implementing Utility AI is pretty straight forward, but it is a lot harder to actually implement something that makes sense and works well together. When I just randomly played around with functions to score considerations, it always left me unsatisfied. After creating the above chart to depict all the stats, considerations, and actions, as well as how they all interact with each other it became a lot easier to see the bigger picture of how everything fits together.

Prior to starting this project (the code portion) I also did a lot of research into how Utility AI works and the different architectures used to build it. This really did speed up development time and made development go a lot smoother compared to my other projects where I just jumped straight into coding.

For future projects I will be sure to plan and diagram things out, as well as do research prior to implementation.
